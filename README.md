# DevOps-Playground-Crossplane

DevOps Playground for Crossplane, first presented 2024-06-27

## Intro

## Initial Setup

As long as you are registered for the Meetup event you can request your environment at the [DevOps Playground Lab](lab.devopsplayground.org) site.

Then, open these links as tabs in a new browser window:

- Wetty Console: http://<your-panda>.devopsplayground.org/wetty
- VSCode text editor: http://<your-panda>.devopsplayground.org:8000

Wetty will act as your terminal and has access to everything you need for the playground - please be aware that many commands will not work properly in VSCode (a quirk of our current setup).

In Wetty, enter the `workdir` directory and run the following to set up a connection to Kubernetes:

```shell
./eks-config.sh
```

(This only contains afew simple commands if you're curious, but "connecting to kubernetes" and "creating secrets" are not the focus of our attention today!)
